# Event-Based Team Lists Implementation

## Summary

I've successfully implemented event-based team lists that change based on the selected event. Here's what was accomplished:

## âœ… **Fixed Build Issues**
- Updated event interface to include proper event codes
- Fixed database schema to include event fields  
- Updated all components to handle the new event structure
- No compilation errors - app builds successfully

## âœ… **Event Codes Implementation**
Updated the event configuration with your provided event codes:

- **District Championships**: `2025pncmp`
- **District Sammamish Event**: `2025wasam` 
- **District Sundome Event**: `2025wayak`

## âœ… **Team List Integration**

### 1. **New Hook: `useEventTeams`**
- Fetches teams from The Blue Alliance API based on selected event
- Falls back to mock data if API is unavailable or no API key
- Provides loading states and error handling
- Returns team info with numbers, nicknames, and keys

### 2. **Updated Team List Page**
- **Location**: `/dashboard/teamlist`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Shows teams for currently selected event
  - Updates automatically when event changes
  - Displays event-specific team counts
  - Shows loading skeletons while fetching
  - Handles errors gracefully with fallback data

### 3. **Enhanced Scouting Forms**
Both pit and match scouting forms now include:
- **Team Number Dropdowns**: Populated with teams from selected event
- **Event Information**: Shows current event in headers
- **Database Integration**: Saves event data with each entry

## âœ… **Key Features**

### **Dynamic Team Loading**
```typescript
// Teams change automatically when event changes
const { teams, loading, error } = useEventTeams();
const teamNumbers = useEventTeamNumbers(); // Just numbers for dropdowns
```

### **Fallback System**
- Tries to fetch from TBA API first
- Falls back to mock data on error or missing API key
- Different mock teams per event for demonstration

### **Event-Specific Data**
- All scouting entries now include event name and code
- Can filter historical data by event
- Easy to separate data between different events

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Implementation**

1. **Switch Events**: Use the sidebar event switcher to change events
2. **View Team Lists**: Go to `/dashboard/teamlist` to see event-specific teams
3. **Scouting Forms**: 
   - Visit `/scout/pitscout` or `/scout/matchscout`
   - Notice team dropdowns are populated with event teams
   - See event badges in the headers
4. **Data Persistence**: All saved data includes event information

## ðŸ”§ **Mock Data Per Event**

Since TBA API requires a key, I've included rich mock data:

- **2025pncmp**: 13 teams including regional powerhouses
- **2025wasam**: 10 teams for smaller regional event  
- **2025wayak**: 9 teams for district event

## ðŸš€ **Production Ready**

To use with real TBA data:
1. Add your TBA API key to environment variables as `TBA_API_KEY`
2. The app will automatically switch from mock to real data
3. Team lists will populate from actual event registrations

## ðŸ“Š **Database Schema Updates**

Added event tracking to both pit and match entries:
- `eventName`: Display name (e.g., "District Championships")
- `eventCode`: TBA event code (e.g., "2025pncmp")

This enables:
- Filtering data by event
- Event-specific analytics
- Multi-event data management

The implementation is fully functional and ready for production use!
